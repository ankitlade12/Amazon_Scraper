  This phone came in and at first it was amazing. No scratches, no marks, and the battery life was 100%. The phone was fast and felt really smooth. But after only just 24 hours, the face ID stopped working. I tried to reset my face ID and tried to reset the phone but none of that fixed it. Aside from this problem the phone was great. 1 stars because face ID was important to me. Also listen to DyGambino on Spotify and iTunes

  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I‚Äôm still happy that I did.

  ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again.

Will not be purchasing any phones off Amazon ever again.

  No way was this a ""Renewed"" Phone - the packaging was superb - the iPhone was BETTER  than description in that it appeared new - it's only been a few days, but after 6 months of Samsung Galaxay Note 10s I am back to over 20 plus years to Apple!

  I was extremely impressed with the condition. Not one scratch or blemish which I was expecting atleast 1 or 2. Exterior condition is no different then a brand new phone. However, as i've now had it for almost 2 weeks I have noticed 2 minor issues with the internal aspect. Unfortunately while charging it (with the charging cord & block that came included with it) I noticed it randomly stops charging sometimes so I have to unplug it then plug it back in. It's happened 3-4x now and I can't figure out why that is. The 2nd issue is that while listening to a podcast the speaker made a weird almost fuzzy/white noise in the background of it. It only happened the one time but was odd. Other then those 2 things it truly is an incredible device and for $610 has 100% been worth it! I'm just hoping no other issues arise separate from the problems all phones acquire from normal wear and tear over time.Thank you!

  I love my new phone, I was skeptical because of some of the bad reviews. But I haven‚Äôt experienced anything bad about my phone yet. It even came with a glass screen protector on it! No outer or inner damage experience or noticed so far. And my phone connected to my Verizon service easily .

  At first I was very skeptical of buying a refurbished iPhone because (1) I read a couple of negative reviews about the seller and (2) I've heard horror stories of customers buying a refurbished iPhone (from any seller) and couldn't use it. But I found a great price on the XS Max and decided to take the plunge and order it. Now I have no regrets of buying this iPhone! The phone is practically brand new.. it arrived in excellent condition, and it was easy to transfer my info from the 7 Plus to this. The only thing is the battery got really hot during the initial setup process. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. Otherwise, I love it! If you want to buy an iPhone at a reduced price, I highly recommend this seller.. you won't be disappointed!

  The sticker on the back of this phone said it was not tested. It came to no surprise that this phone had a half green screen when I turned it on.Company tried to make ME pay for the return shipping of their defective product. I sorted it out with customer service (at first they implied that I should pay it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs only like 6 or 7 dollars‚Äù - but agreed to reimburse me if I included receipt for shipping). It‚Äôs the principle!They wasted my time. They didn‚Äôt take the time to test their product and then cost me my time to call them, buy a new gift instead, go to the post office to mail (they don‚Äôt offer pre-paid labels), write my first Amazon review, etc...They should offer pre-paid labels, test their phones and not charge return shipping for defective products. I wouldn‚Äôt do business with a company like this ever again. Treat your customers better!!

  So I got a long extended charger with my phone, which I thought was a plus, rather than the short original one. Until I put my new phone charge and it didn‚Äôt charge. Thanks for a BROKEN charger.As for the phone itself, seems like everything‚Äôs good. Last phone I bought from Amazon turned on and everything but once I put the SIM card in it still said no sim, no network. Took it to Verizon, the gave us a new SIM and still nothing.

It‚Äôs a very beautiful looking phone and is very responsive especially with the face recognition. That works very well even in low light settings, or if you have sunglasses and a hat on.

The one I got is fully unlocked to GSM and CDMA networks so you can use it for any cell phone provider as long as you have a SIM card which it does not come with. It does come with a SIM tool as well as a generic charger and short cable which I just have tucked away as spares.

We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)  trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could

  I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.

  Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!

  I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)  trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could

  If you activate the find my phone function, and forget your phone apple id password (e.g., if you leave it behind on a foreign trip and do not use it for a while) Apple does not let you reset it, so you cannot get applications, etc, or get a replacement battery. I change my phone number regularly every few months, because I keep getting calls with offers, etc. Even though I have the same email and can prove that I bought the iphone, Apple will not reset the Apple ID password, because I do not remember the last telephone number that I used on that phone when I created the ID! The employee sounded gleeful and not at all regretful, so I will not ever by Apple products again. Android phones are never this much trouble. What a waste of money!

  The product came with continuous software issues. The product was not damaged, and like all Apple products was packaged quite well. With that said, after booting it up I ran into non-stop issues. Everything from getting into my Apple ID Account, to getting my information transferred over. I spent most of my first day on the phone with Apple Care.Aside from having that largest bezels, smallest battery (2,815mAh), slowest refresh rates (60Hz), and overpriced hardware, it looks nice and has a very fast processor! All things said, 5G is several years out and this phone is too. ¬†For $800+ the Samsung S20FE or OnePlus 8 would be amazing alternatives. ¬†Heck I would even buy the Pixel 5 over this.Apple please listen to your customer base. ¬†They don't want 5G or even better cameras. YOU'RE APPLE! This phone should have the smallest bezels, the largest battery, at least 8GB or RAM and 120Hz screen refresh like everyone else in the industry has been had for a year! Then you can charge $800 without a charger... lolCome on now!

  I‚Äôve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I‚Äôve played with the X, and was disappointed.Pros:Battery life is superior to anything I‚Äôve ownedReception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone.The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It‚Äôs flawless in your hands.It‚Äôs faster than any galaxy or iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9)The apps are just designed better.I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever.3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does.The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality.You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS.Wireless charging is lightning fastSeamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!!The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loudThe new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. StunningCons:PriceyNo headphone jackAll glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on.No headphones includedNo cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue)The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality)Overall this truly is an incredible device.

  INTRO  I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery.IDEAL USER  The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations.CAMERA  In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken.BATTERY LIFE  The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two.OVERALL  Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.

  I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months.Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews.  I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone.EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all. I'm considering doing a return.

So far so great!

  6 Months Later update - Still acts like I bought it yesterday. Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

  I have always purchased renewed cell phones and never had a problem, until this time. This phone was supposed to be like new, in excellent condition, with minimal signs of wear. I had taken it out of the box, and it had a filmy cover on the front and back. I thought That was awesome until I suddenly noticed something looked amiss under the protective cover. I lifted it back to find a chip in the bottom of the screen with the telltale spider crack going out in several directions. Trying to give the seller the benefit of the doubt I held it out at arm‚Äôs length. Definitely noticeable. And a huge problem for the longevity of the phone. Scratches and dings are one thing. A chip in the screen with connecting cracks? Come on, now! I just paid over $700 for this phone and don‚Äôt need to go pay for a screen replacement on top of that plus all of the time and stress to go with it.I immediately initiated a return request, which was approved and surprise again! I get to pay the return shipping on a product that arrived damaged and was not in the condition the seller promised it would be in.And now I‚Äôm left wondering if they will try to assess a restocking fee even though the phone doesn‚Äôt look like new and is not in excellent condition.I‚Äôm pretty upset at this.

  I bought this phone for my son that lives in Jamaica as a Christmas gift.You see I was so nervous and skeptical to buy this phone. because of the mixed reviews.the phone came with a charger, the pin to pull out the SIM card draw, a receipt and a instruction card if you‚Äôre gonna send it back. The phone and everything mentioned was packed in a nice box.The phone is clean and looks brand new. no scratches or scrapes. it‚Äôs also unlocked which is what i payEd for.

  I‚Äôve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I‚Äôve played with the X, and was disappointed.Pros:Battery life is superior to anything I‚Äôve ownedReception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone.The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It‚Äôs flawless in your hands.It‚Äôs faster than any galaxy or iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9)The apps are just designed better.I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever.3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does.The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality.You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS.Wireless charging is lightning fastSeamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!!The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loudThe new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. StunningCons:PriceyNo headphone jackAll glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on.No headphones includedNo cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue)The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality)Overall this truly is an incredible device.

  INTRO  I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery.IDEAL USER  The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations.CAMERA  In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken.BATTERY LIFE  The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two.OVERALL  Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.

  i always buy my phones on amazon. it's always cheaper and more convenient. i have since upgraded to the xs max, but i loved this phone when i had it. there were absolutely no flaws when i received it (cracks, dents, scratches, etc). it looked and operated like a brand new iphone. all of the switches, touch id, cameras, etc worked perfectly fine. i used this with straight talk and had no issues putting my sim card in and getting signal.one thing to note is that you will have to buy your own headphone adapter (they're about $9 on apple's website) if you don't have airpods/wireless headphones since the headphone jack is now gone. the package only included a white box, the phone in protective films, a couple of info papers, and a charger.overall, i'm extremely happy with my purchase and i will buy again if the time arises.

  i always buy my phones on amazon. it's always cheaper and more convenient. i have since upgraded to the xs max, but i loved this phone when i had it. there were absolutely no flaws when i received it (cracks, dents, scratches, etc). it looked and operated like a brand new iphone. all of the switches, touch id, cameras, etc worked perfectly fine. i used this with straight talk and had no issues putting my sim card in and getting signal.one thing to note is that you will have to buy your own headphone adapter (they're about $9 on apple's website) if you don't have airpods/wireless headphones since the headphone jack is now gone. the package only included a white box, the phone in protective films, a couple of info papers, and a charger.overall, i'm extremely happy with my purchase and i will buy again if the time arises.

  Received the phone and took it to AT&T to have them swap the SIM card from my old phone to this iPhone 8+. Couldn't make outbound calls or messages, only iMessages on WiFi. Called AT&T and they said the phone was locked in their system and had been flagged as Lost or Stolen, and they wouldn't unlock it without the original purchaser's consent. Phone un-usable.

  I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

  I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

A great phone from a great seller!

  These cannot possibly be certified refurbished as stated. Both phone batteries were so dead when I received them it took a day to charge. One phone has a camera that does not work.
